## 3.3.0 - 2019-06-11

### Added

- [zendframework/zend-test#76](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-test/pull/76) adds support for PHPUnit 8
  
  Undesired PHPUnit update to ^8.0 can happen on PHP 7.2 and newer when relying
  on PHPUnit installation as an indirect dependency via laminas-test.
  Please always declare direct dependency on `phpunit/phpunit` with suitable
  versions alongside with `laminas/laminas-test`.
  
  PHPUnit 8 incompatible test suite typically would error after the update
  with messages like "Fatal error: Declaration of *::setUp() must be
  compatible with *::setUp(): void" for any of the following methods:

  - `setUpBeforeClass()`
  - `tearDownAfterClass()`
  - `setUp()`
  - `tearDown()`

  Following command can be used to declare explicit dependency on older PHPUnit versions:
  ```bash
  composer require --dev phpunit/phpunit:"^7.5.12 || ^6.5.14 || ^5.7.14" --update-with-dependencies
  ```

### Fixed

- [zendframework/zend-test#33](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-test/pull/33) fixes
  `queryContentRegexAssertion()` (used by `assertQueryContentRegex()` and
  `assertXpathQueryContentRegex()`) properly checks all matching nodes for
  content matching the regular expression, instead of only the first. The
  prevents false negative assertions from occuring.
- [zendframework/zend-test#21](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-test/pull/21) updates the
  `sebastian/version` dependency to also allow v2.0 releases.
- [zendframework/zend-test#31](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-test/pull/31) fixes an issue with
  the `AbstractControllerTestCase` when used to test a console request.
  Previously, routes with multiple literal flags were never matched; they now
  are.

### Removed

### Fixed

- [zendframework/zend-test#26](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-test/pull/26) fixes how

  assertion failures now append a list of all exception messages to the base
  message when the flag is enabled.
